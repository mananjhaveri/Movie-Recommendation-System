## Authors:guardsman:
This project is made by [Manan Jhaveri](https://github.com/mananjhaveri) and [Devanshu Ramaiya](https://github.com/devanshu125).

## Web-App
You can find the app [here](https://movie-recommendations-system.herokuapp.com/).

## Summary:clipboard:
This is a web app which recommends movies based on their plots found on IMDb.

## Datasets:open_file_folder:
We have scraped the title and summary and genre of movies from IMDb. You can find that [here](imdb_movie_summary.xlsx). The file named [df_transformed](df_transformed.csv) contains all the data after processing. We have used TfidfVectorizer (for creating a csr matrix) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization(NMF) in this case.

## Blog✍️
We have also explained this project in detail on [DataPhrase](https://dataphrase.github.io/). [Part-1](https://dataphrase.github.io/movierec1/) explains how we scraped data from the IMDb website and [Part-2](https://dataphrase.github.io/movierec2/) explains how we used basic Natural Language Processing techniques to prepare a movie recommendation system.
